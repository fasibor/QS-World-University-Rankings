![Task 34B Dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c5f8b40-2ff3-48e7-96fd-cf1ee468dbc6)

 **Overview**  
This analysis reviews the 2025 QS World University Rankings, comparing changes from 2024 across universities, regions, and countries. It highlights upward and downward movements in global positioning, evaluates performance by institutional type, and dissects key ranking metrics including academic reputation, employer perception, faculty-student ratio, and citations per faculty. The aim is to guide academic leaders, policymakers, and stakeholders in improving institutional excellence and global competitiveness.


 **Objectives**  
- Track ranking shifts among top global universities  
- Analyze performance by country, region, and institution type  
- Identify research and teaching drivers behind ranking changes  
- Evaluate key metrics: research intensity, citations, employment outcomes  
- Recommend strategies for sustainable academic improvement  



 **Why This Project is Useful**  
Global rankings shape funding, student enrollment, partnerships, and policy. This analysis:
- Highlights high-performing and at-risk institutions  
- Reveals the influence of research, faculty, and graduate outcomes  
- Helps universities understand and close performance gaps  
- Informs national education strategies and international engagement  
- Supports evidence-based improvement across regions and systems  


 **Key Findings**

- **Global Rank Change**  
 remained at rank 1; Imperial rose from 6 to 2; Oxford stayed in the top 3; Harvard held 4th place; Cambridge declined from 2 to 5; Stanford dropped from 5 to 6.

- **Country and Region Ranking Shifts**  
The UK improved from 6 to 2 overall but had one institution drop from 2 to 5. The US remained at rank 5. Switzerland and Singapore maintained their respective positions at 7 and 8. 


- **Research Intensity by Status**  
Private universities scored highest in research intensity (36), followed by public (34), and others (24).

- **Comparison of Regions by Average Score**  
Oceania leads (44), followed by Europe (32), Americas (30), Asia (28), Africa (25), and Not Classified (21).


- **Institutions with Improved Rankings**  
China led with 31 improved institutions, followed by the UK (21), Germany (19), US (18), and both Australia and India/South Korea (12 each).

- **Top 6 Countries with Declined University Rankings**  
The US saw 81 institutions decline, followed by the UK (36), Germany (18), Austria (13), China (9), South Korea (7), and India (4). 


- **Faculty–Student Ratio Impact**  
MIT, Stanford, and Caltech scored 100, showing a strong link between smaller class sizes and higher ranks.

- **Citations per Faculty**  
MIT leads, with Imperial, Oxford, and Harvard also showing high research impact.

- **Employment Outcomes**  
MIT, Harvard, and Cambridge scored 100; Imperial, Oxford, and ETH Zurich also performed strongly.


- **Academic Reputation**  
Asia and Europe have the strongest academic reputation scores; Oceania, Africa, and Not Classified regions lag.


**Actionable Recommendations**  
- Cambridge and Stanford should audit research and faculty-student metrics. Leaders like MIT and Oxford should continue innovating to retain competitive advantage.
- The UK must foster internal collaboration. The US should address systemic imbalances. Switzerland and Singapore should focus on sustaining innovation.
- Enhance industry partnerships. Low-performing institutions should build research ecosystems and faculty capacity.
- Africa and Unclassified regions need reform and investment. Asia and the Americas can close gaps by emulating top regions.
- Scale and share success stories. Support institutional autonomy and link funding to outcomes.  
- Develop recovery frameworks focusing on engagement, outcomes, and quality assurance.
- Hire more faculty, lower class sizes, and enhance student support systems.
- Encourage high-impact, interdisciplinary publications and global research collaboration.
- Integrate career support into programs, expand employer links, and build real-world learning pathways.
- Low-reputation regions should invest in academic visibility, conferences, and international faculty programs


**Final Thoughts**  
This report underscores the dynamic nature of global academic competition. Institutions and countries that proactively improve research, student support, and international visibility will lead the future of higher education. Strategic, data-informed actions are essential for sustainable academic excellence.
